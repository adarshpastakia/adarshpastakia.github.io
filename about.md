<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n a nutshell, &ldquo;a Pink Floyd nut in love with coffee&rdquo;. Having tried most of everything from databases to networking, spent a decade learning, developing and working on web application development specifically on UI/UX.</p>

Been learning programming for 22 years and am still at it, the learning never ends. :)

The journey from FoxPro to Visual Basic and Java Swing, and now the labyrinth of JavaScript Frontend Frameworks. From Prototype to jQuery, YUI to ExtJS and to the modern days of Angular and React, and not to forget the one I love most __Aurelia__.

From making data-entry forms and reports on a character-based interface to DHTML (apparently named DynamicHTML) and into the modern day of intuitive UI/UX designs and ever complex world of business applications.
